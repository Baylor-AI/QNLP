# Instructions<a name="instructions"></a>
This material is created by different authors, therefore you will be sure about the source if you find 
any detail, please, let me know and I will fix it.

There are some concepts from quantum computing what you probably don't know, 
it is ok, I will share with you references, papers, and books to read, but 
consider that on NLP, quantum computing topics are out of the scope of the course.

To check quantum computing concepts, check Nielsen and Chuang book [[1]](#references), to know how parameterized in quantum circuits [[2]](#references), some QNLP tools can be found in ref. [[3]](#references)
if you want to know more about text structure [[4]](#references), 

## Purpose

The main goal in these sessions is to create a QNLP collaborative repository, therefore you should clone and work with Pull Request.

# Introduction<a name="intro"></a>



Quantum computing is an interesting field to work. It is an area with some applications and it can be powerful if it is combined with Machine Learning area.
Recently, we can explore applications on several topics such as computer vision, cybersecurity, economy, finance, science and others.
In particular, this repository is to create an interesting and repository on QNLP to help your career on the next generation of scientists.


Consider this a recent topic and it very probably you have a lot questions without solve, but don't worry, it is part to be a scientist.


# Implementation<a name="instructions"></a>

Create your and NB into the examples folder, and try to explain every step. 
Don't forget to write your name and your contributor names.

- Use readme.md into the examples folder to provide a summary.
- Use Pull Request to maintain this repository with the last version, when you send the PR, put my user name (jaorduz) to approve the work.
