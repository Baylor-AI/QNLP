# Instructions<a name="instructions"></a>
This material is created by different authors, therefore you will be sure about the source if you find 
any detail, please, let me know and I will fix it.

There are some concepts from quantum computing what you probably don't know, 
it is ok, I will share with you references, papers, and books to read, but 
consider that on NLP, quantum computing topics are out of the scope of the course.

To check quantum computing concepts, check Nielsen and Chuang book [[1]](#references), to know how parameterized in quantum circuits [[2]](#references), some QNLP tools can be found in ref. [[3]](#references)
if you want to know more about text structure [[4]](#references),
